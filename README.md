# H5CPP documentation (Sandbox)

[H5CPP](http://h5cpp.org) is template only persistence for modern C++ with compiler assisted reflection. To take the notch a step higher, this improved documentation revels more internals of the project, as well as provides examples how to integrate H5CPP in your next C++ project.


The  [mkdocs](http://mkdocs.org) based documentation pages may be compiled with: `mkdocs build`, or during development a live version is available with: `mkdocs serve`.

The pages maybe viewed live at [sandbox](http://sandbox.h5cpp.org)

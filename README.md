# H5CPP documentation (Sandbox)

[H5CPP](http://h5cpp.org) is template-only persistence for modern C++ with compiler assisted reflection. To take it up a notch, this improved documentation reveals more project internals, as well as it provides examples of how to integrate H5CPP with your next C++ project.


The [mkdocs](http://mkdocs.org)-based documentation pages may be compiled with: `mkdocs build`, or during development a live version is available with: `mkdocs serve`.

The pages maybe viewed live at [sandbox](http://sandbox.h5cpp.org)
